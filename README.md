# dot-files
This is my personal configs for a fast workflow. Please wear your seat belt before using the configs, as you are going to fly while coding! 


### TMUX
I use TMUX to open two panes, one for compiling source code and the other for writing code. Yes keep it minimal. 
* Prefix key : <CTRL + a>
* Vim Mode enabled using : <CTRL + a + [> 

**ATTENSION** : i can't figure out how to copy from vim in the first pane into the other. If you know an easy way, please hit me up! 

### VIM

fzf, coc, goyo, markdown-preview, vim-latex-live-preview and more! 

* Install vim-plug in order to be able to use the config.
* `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins 
* `:PlugClean` to remove delted plugins 
* `:PlugUpdate` to update current plugins

#### Markdown 

* Enable with :MarkdownPreview 
* Opens a markdown in your browser and it will update while typing. Also cursor will be tracked. Thanks markdown-preview!

#### Latex 

* Enable with <F> 
* Opens pdf youre working on and can live update while coding in latex.
